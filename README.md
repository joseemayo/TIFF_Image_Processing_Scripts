This script contains Phython scripts that were utilized to analyze, combine/merge TIFF images.

The use case for this script is discerning if a luminescent sample is present using a fluorescent microscope with low sensitivity and luminscent samples with dull luminescence.

By combining and merging the TIFF images produced by the microscope, the potentially luminscent objects are amplified and luminescence over background noise can be evaluated.
