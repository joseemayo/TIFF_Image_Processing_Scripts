These Phython scripts were utilized to analyze, combine/merge TIFF images.

**Reference File: ** _09_27_TIFF_Image_Processing_Script.py_

The use case for this script is discerning if a luminescent sample is present in images take from a fluorescent microscope with low sensitivity and a dull luminescence samples. (Poor equipment and poor samples)

By combining and merging the TIFF images produced by the microscope, the potentially luminscent objects are amplified and luminescence over background noise can be evaluated.
